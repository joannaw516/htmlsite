<b>Final Takeaways</b>
During these last 4 weeks, it has been a marathon to get our Eventbrite website, UX/UI, and analytics. We have been able to successfully finish all the functionality, and have our cumulative findings below.
 
<b>Burn Down Chart</b>
This week we wrapped up our deliverables and Google Analytics. The cumulative burndown chart is below (Note: the flat surface is mostly due to the Thanksgiving break):

<b>Traffic Analysis: </b>
Since getting Google Analytics up and running, our website has tracked roughly 4100 visitors. The distribution of our referrals so far has been the following:
40.13% (1654 visitors) are from the law school (http://law.yale.edu/)
31.95% (1317 visitors) are from the med school (http://medicine.yale.edu/)
19.92% (821 visitors) are from the search engine (http://search.yale.edu)
Having only started recording website analytics since November 9th, we do not have analytics on our customers from before then.

<b>A/B Test: “Donate” or “Support”</b>
When we switched from the “Donate” to “Support” text on December 2nd, we were able to determine that the latter drives more donations on the events detail pages than the former.  “Support” accumulated 470/1577 clicks on events 1,2,3,5 (29.8%) from November 25-December 1, whereas “Donate” only gains 178/1478 clicks (12.0%) from December 2 - 9.   


<p>As we clarified our roles and responsibilities within the sprint, we started focusing on creating user personas and stories to enhance the customer experience on our website. Nick and Jacob have been tag teaming on the coding early on in the week, even attending office hours to help get the events page up. On Thursday, we came together to look at the Google Analytics, only to realize that we had submitted the wrong URL which is why it was not registering. One open issue that we are still troubleshooting is why our own visits are not registering in the analytics.. We also clarified that Understanding that we needed to complete all the tasks in the sprint backlog on Thursday, Jacob created a Google Sheet to re-allocate the remaining tasks, helped code the html, and brought in Joanna to help with the debugging. Since then, we have been ramping up on our coding. Due to others’ recruiting trips and pending deadlines, Diana took on the responsibility of allocating story points to the tasks and creating the burndown chart. </p>

This week, we focused on completing the functionality while deriving insights from our Google Analytics. Specifically, we wanted to understand who was driving traffic to our website, if there were any referrals, and conduct the A/B test on whether “Donate” or “Support” would drive the most donations. Nick and Jacob frontloaded the code due to scheduling availability as well as the need to A/B test. Once the code was done, Nick rallied the others on remaining tasks for the sprint. Diana worked on the report and aggregate burndown chart, Joanna conducted the traffic analysis, and Jacob produced the insights for the A/B tests.  

<b>Burn Down Chart</b>
There is no more tasks left to be completed, and has been a pleasure working on this team during the 4-week sprint.
