<p>As we clarified our roles and responsibilities within the sprint, we started focusing on creating user personas and stories to enhance the customer experience on our website. Nick and Jacob have been tag teaming on the coding early on in the week, even attending office hours to help get the events page up. On Thursday, we came together to look at the Google Analytics, only to realize that we had submitted the wrong URL which is why it was not registering. One open issue that we are still troubleshooting is why our own visits are not registering in the analytics.. We also clarified that Understanding that we needed to complete all the tasks in the sprint backlog on Thursday, Jacob created a Google Sheet to re-allocate the remaining tasks, helped code the html, and brought in Joanna to help with the debugging. Since then, we have been ramping up on our coding. Due to others’ recruiting trips and pending deadlines, Diana took on the responsibility of allocating story points to the tasks and creating the burndown chart. </p>

We will also look into clarifying product owner and scrum master responsibilities to ensure everyone is effectively contributing and executing in the sprints. </p>
