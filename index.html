<b>Final Takeaways</b>
<p>During these last 4 weeks, it has been a marathon to get our Eventbrite website, UX/UI, and analytics. <br>We have been able to successfully finish all the functionality, and have our cumulative findings below. </p>
 
<b>Burn Down Chart</b>
This week we wrapped up our deliverables and Google Analytics. <br>The cumulative burndown chart is below (Note: the flat surface is mostly due to the Thanksgiving break):

<b>Traffic Analysis: </b>
Since getting Google Analytics up and running, our website has tracked roughly 4100 visitors. <br>The distribution of our referrals so far has been the following:
<br>&#8226;40.13% (1654 visitors) are from the law school (http://law.yale.edu/)
<br>&#8226;31.95% (1317 visitors) are from the med school (http://medicine.yale.edu/)
<br>&#8226;19.92% (821 visitors) are from the search engine (http://search.yale.edu)
<br>Having only started recording website analytics since November 9th, we do not have analytics on our customers from before then.

<b>A/B Test: <q>Donate</q> or <q>Support</q></b>
When we switched from the <q>Donate</q> to <q>Support</q> text on December 2nd, we were able to determine that the latter drives more donations on the events detail pages than the former.  <br><q>Support</q> accumulated 470/1577 clicks on events 1,2,3,5 (29.8%) from November 25-December 1, whereas <q>Donate</q> only gains 178/1478 clicks (12.0%) from December 2 - 9.   


<p>As we clarified our roles and responsibilities within the sprint, we started focusing on creating user personas and stories to enhance the customer experience on our website. <br>Nick and Jacob have been tag teaming on the coding early on in the week, even attending office hours to help get the events page up. <br>On Thursday, we came together to look at the Google Analytics, only to realize that we had submitted the wrong URL which is why it was not registering. <br>One open issue that we are still troubleshooting is why our own visits are not registering in the analytics.. <br>We also clarified that Understanding that we needed to complete all the tasks in the sprint backlog on Thursday, Jacob created a Google Sheet to re-allocate the remaining tasks, helped code the html, and brought in Joanna to help with the debugging. <br>Since then, we have been ramping up on our coding. <br>Due to others’ recruiting trips and pending deadlines, Diana took on the responsibility of allocating story points to the tasks and creating the burndown chart. </p>

This week, we focused on completing the functionality while deriving insights from our Google Analytics. <br>Specifically, we wanted to understand who was driving traffic to our website, if there were any referrals, and conduct the A/B test on whether “Donate” or “Support” would drive the most donations. <br>Nick and Jacob frontloaded the code due to scheduling availability as well as the need to A/B test. <br>Once the code was done, Nick rallied the others on remaining tasks for the sprint. <br>Diana worked on the report and aggregate burndown chart, Joanna conducted the traffic analysis, and Jacob produced the insights for the A/B tests.  

<b>Burn Down Chart</b>
There is no more tasks left to be completed, and has been a pleasure working on this team during the 4-week sprint.
